# Workspacer
Tmux session manager on steroids ðŸ’‰

# Goals
- Get conveniently open projects within multiple workspaces (personal, work, etc)
- Be able to select workspace by a set alias in shell config 
```
alias space1="workspacer -W=space1" 
```
- Use of TUIs to make project and session selections
- Pull in info from github with github client
    - Be able to pull in different gh accounts based on workspaces (one gh account for work and one personal)
